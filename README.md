# Orders Management App

A basic Orders Management App built with **Laravel 7** and **PHP 7**, that allows you to CRUD orders, receive an email notification with your invoice and to download the PDF invoice from the UI.

> ðŸ•˜ This is a reupload of a small test project originally built 5 years ago, now containerized with Docker for easier setup and portability.

## Technologies

- PHP 7.4+
- Laravel 7.x
- MySQL 5.7 (via Docker)
- Basic Bootstrap frontend
- Dockerized with Apache


## Setup 

> This project uses Docker for easy setup and environment isolation.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dgbusiness/orders-management-app.git
